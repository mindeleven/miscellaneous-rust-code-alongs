# Asynchronous Programming in Rust with Tokyo

This is a code along with an online book on Asynchronous Programming with the Tokyo Rust libaray to get a better understanding of how and why to use async/.await with Rust.

## Getting started with writing asynchronous Rust code

Coding along with the [Tokio tutorial](https://tokio.rs/tokio/tutorial) that can be found online.

”[Tokio](https://tokio.rs/tokio/tutorial) is an asynchronous runtime for the Rust programming language. It provides the building blocks needed for writing networking applications. It gives the flexibility to target a wide range of systems, from large servers with dozens of cores to small embedded devices.”
